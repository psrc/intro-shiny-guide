# `shinythemes`

[shinythemes](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/) is an easy alternative to the default bootstrap theme that is inherent in Shiny. Depending on the theme, it can change fonts, sizing, and color palettes.

```{r}
library(shinythemes)
```

After loading the library, apply one of the shiny themes as seen here: https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/.

```{r}
# UI

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # apply a shiny theme
  theme = shinytheme("flatly"),
  
  title,
  src,
  
  .
  .
  .
)
```

Or use the theme selector to try out different themes before committing to one.

```{r}
# UI

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # test different shiny themes with the theme selector
  themeSelector(),
  
  title,
  src,
  
  .
  .
  .
)
```


# `bslib`


# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for describing the style and layout of a document. For anyone who has used extensive CSS, frustration is a common theme! 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Working with CSS. We Bare Bears. https://devrant.com/rants/236669/css-in-a-nutshell."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_236669_egRwe.gif")
```
