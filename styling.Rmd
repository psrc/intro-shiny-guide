```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for describing the style and layout of a document. You can always use CSS, but depending on what you're trying to accomplish, it may not be easy.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Working with CSS. We Bare Bears. https://devrant.com/rants/236669/css-in-a-nutshell."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_236669_egRwe.gif")
```

Part of the difficulty is that by default, Shiny utilizes Bootstrap--a CSS framework. Styles are already in place! `shinythemes` and `bslib` are a couple of packages to help override Bootstrap to customize the appearance of your app.

# `shinythemes`

[shinythemes](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/) is an easy alternative to the default bootstrap theme that is inherent in Shiny. Depending on the theme, it can change fonts, sizing, and color palettes.

```{r}
library(shinythemes)
```

After loading the library, use the theme selector to try out different themes before committing to one.

```{r}
# UI

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # test different shiny themes with the theme selector
  themeSelector(),

  
  title,
  src,
  .
  .
  .
)
```

Apply one of the shiny themes.

```{r}
# UI

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # apply a shiny theme
  theme = shinytheme("flatly"),
  
  title,
  src,
  .
  .
  .
)
```

# `bslib`

A recent package, [bslib](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/index.html), was designed to [make it a little easier](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/styling-shiny-apps-with-sass-and-bootstrap-4/) to override Bootstrap settings. Unlike `shinythemes`, fonts and color can be set for different parts of the document.

To find available Google Fonts see: [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)

```{r}
library(bslib)
```

```{r}
#UI

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # use bslib's previewer
  theme = bs_theme() %>% bs_theme_preview(),

  title,
  src,
  .
  .
  .
)
```

After testing, customize your theme by setting the arguments in `bs_theme()`.

```{r}
#UI

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # set the arguments
  theme = bs_theme(primary = "#FF00F3", 
                   heading_font = font_google("Pacifico"), 
                   spacer = "2rem"),

  title,
  src,
  .
  .
  .
)
  
```
