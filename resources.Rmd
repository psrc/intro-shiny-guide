# Shiny

**[Shiny Gallery's Shiny Demo](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#demos)**: interactive examples of various Shiny features (individual widgets, layout styles, and reactivity). The source code is displayed as you interact with the examples. It's a great way to learn! 

**[Official Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/shiny.pdf)**: A two-pager of Shiny utilities. 

**[Mastering Shiny Book](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html)**: A book (in progress) by Hadley Wickham. See the *Getting Started* section. For those who use the tidyverse, it also includes a section on the latest version of *tidy evaluation*--essential for programming with packages like dplyr or ggplot2.

# Visualization Packages

## DT

### Other htmlwidgets

## Reactable

Another interactive table package. On the surface, basic use of [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) might not be that different than DT, but the ability to create expandable rows and nested tables, and the conditional styling examples really makes this package stand out.

To see a Shiny app with a reactable table in the wild, see [this reactable example](https://christy-lam.shinyapps.io/ofm-wa-estimates/), code is available [here](https://github.com/cyyllam/ofm-wa-estimates).
