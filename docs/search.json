There are some choices to make in the beginning: a single file app or a multi-page one. It will depend on how you like to organize your code, how much code there will be, and the number of collaborators for the app. For this first part of the session, we will learn with a single file app.\r\nTemplates\r\nYou can write from scratch or you can open a template to get a head start.\r\nClick the drop down on the New File icon  and select Shiny Web App\r\nThe Application Name will be the name of the directory storing your app file.\r\nSelect Single File\r\nSave it inside the intro-shiny project directory or another place.\r\n\r\nOperating the app\r\nViewer options\r\nBefore you hit Run App  the drop down offers several options for viewing:\r\nRun in Window (RStudio’s pop-up browser)\r\nRun in Viewer Pane\r\nRun External (your default browser)\r\nRun and Stop\r\nAfter clicking Run App, your app will be running locally and your R session will be listening to the localhost. Your console will not respond.\r\nClick on the stop sign icon  to stop your app and resume your R session. If running externally, closing your default browser window does not stop the app.\r\nFile Name\r\nThe file name when using a single file app must be called app.R in order to deploy properly.\r\nFor teaching and learning purposes, the files provided for this module will use a different naming system to show app development at different stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

See the first module on R Basics for guidance.\r\nInstall the following packages by running the following code snippet in the console of your RStudio IDE. Ignore any warnings regarding Rtools and if you are asked to install from sources which needs compilation, click ‘No’.\r\n\r\nSome may have already been installed from previous modules. You can adapt the code snippet accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(c(\"shiny\", \"shinythemes\", \"DT\", \"here\", \"rsconnect\", \r\n                   \"tidyverse\", \"scales\", \"plotly\", \"data.table\", \"sf\", \"leaflet\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTest\r\nTest to make sure Shiny works by copying and pasting the code snippet into the console of the RStudio IDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\nif (interactive()) {\r\n  shinyApp(\r\n    ui <- fluidPage(\r\n      selectInput(\"variable\", \"Variable:\",\r\n                  c(\"Cylinders\" = \"cyl\",\r\n                    \"Transmission\" = \"am\",\r\n                    \"Gears\" = \"gear\")),\r\n      tableOutput(\"data\")\r\n    ),\r\n    server <- function(input, output) {\r\n      output$data <- renderTable({\r\n        mtcars[, c(\"mpg\", input$variable), drop = FALSE]\r\n      }, rownames = TRUE)\r\n    }\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional\r\nRainbow Parenthesis\r\n\r\nTurn on rainbow parenthesis.

When working with a multi-page app, having at least 2 files opened side-by-side might be more ergonomic. After adding additional columns, you can open scripts and drag and drop them in either column.\r\nClick on the pane icon .

If you want to deploy a project (non-PSRC related and not something with confidential or sensitive data), shinyapps.io is an option.\r\nNote that deleting an account requires you to contact support@rstudio.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nshinyapps.io, an app hosting service by RStudio, offers a free account option, but with limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
